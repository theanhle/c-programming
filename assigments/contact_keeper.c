/* CONTACT KEEPER
 * ==============
 * 
 * So far, you've been learning the C programing language about two weeks.
 * Now is the right time to think about your assignment.
 * This semester, your task is to write a C program, namely Contact Keeper,
 * to manage your contacts easily and effectively.
 * 
 * One contact should have the following features:
 *		1. First Name
 *		2. Last Name
 *		3. Company
 *		3. Phone Number
 *		4. Email
 *		5. Working Address
 *		6. Home Address
 *		7. Birthday
 *
 * Data validation should be implemented, for example:
 *		1. Phone Number should be a number of 9 or 10 digits
 *		2. Bithday should be in the DD/MM/YYYY format 
 *
 * Your program should have at least six functions:
 *		1. Add new contact
 *		2. Edit contact
 *		3. Delete contact (by name or phone number)
 *		4. Search contact (by name or phone number)
 *		5. List all contacts with birthdays in a given month (sort by date)
 *		6. List all contacts in the table format (sort by name)
 *
 * The contact information should be permanently stored in a text file
 * so that when the program starts all contacts could be loaded automatically.
 *
 * Form a group of three members and enjoy this task!
